Project Objectives
Objective 1: Research, develop, and test a plan to meet Evidence Act requirements for a 
comprehensive Forest Service data inventory, including metadata, and accompanying searchable 
data catalog. This is envisioned to be a multi-step process involving researching and evaluating 
metadata standards relevant to Forest Service work; researching and evaluating potential data 
catalogs relevant to Forest Service work; evaluating selected metadata and data catalog
components on at least one substantive body of Forest Service data.

Objective 2: Inventory and catalog datasets (including metadata, glossaries, data dictionaries, 
etc.) related to the Wildfire Crisis Strategy. Inventorying / cataloging other datasets is a longterm interest of the Forest Service and can be incorporated into this project as time allows.

Objective 3: Create and test connections between the selected Forest Service data catalog 
platform and the USDA enterprise data catalog and data governance platform (currently Axon)

Objective 5: Research, develop, and test the proposed data publication capability using a subset 
of the inventory from Objective 2. Ensure published datasets are marketed through the Federal 
data catalog (currently data.gov) and, for geospatial datasets, the Federal Geographic Data 
Committee’s GeoPlatform

Scope of data and approach
The scope of affected data potentially ranges from Districts to Forests to Regions to the entire 
National Forest System (i.e., national in scope). Wildfire data span not only the described 
geographic scope, but also span multiple national programs outside of the National Forest 
System. The envisioned approach is for the data librarian to work with the Forest Service’s 
Research Data Services program to achieve the objectives. Research Data Services and the 
Forest Service Chief Data Officer will provide guidance to the data librarian and assist in making 
connections (e.g., with the appropriate principals for the USDA Axon Data Governance 
platform). As the steps in the objectives require Forest Service decisions before the next part of 
the research project can proceed, the Chief Data Officer will play a substantive role in the 
project. Because a successful proof of concept should have a broad effect on Forest Service data 
creators and data users, the data librarian can expect to work with a wide variety of Forest 
Service programs and units.
